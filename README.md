## What is mmoCore
### Introduction
mmoCore is the base upon all the mmo... plugins should be built. It adds some extra GUI objects as well as internal plugin managing and some great APIs to use.
### Why create something that already exists?
Fact is, this doesn't already exist. A similar thing exists, but it isn't nearly as flexible as the mmoMinecraft Suite will be.
